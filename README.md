## 4. Methods & Code

### 4.1 Data Analyst Techniques Used (Detailed)

> âœ… This section outlines the SQL-based analytics approach: aggregating and filtering EV data since 2010, calculating KPIs (market size, mix, range), ranking top makes/models, segmenting by state and eligibility, and structuring queries to support market strategy and policy decisions.

#### 4.1.1 Data Aggregation (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, `GROUP BY`)
- Compute **totals/averages** for core KPIs.
- Segment by **year**, **state**, **make**, **model**, **EV type**.

#### 4.1.2 KPI Calculation (Market Size, Mix, Technology)
- **Total Vehicles**, **% mix (BEV/PHEV)**, **Average Electric Range**.
- Ensured consistent decimal precision for reporting.

#### 4.1.3 Market Composition & Ranking
- **Top 10 makes/models** using `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT`.
- Contribution to total via **percentage-of-total** expressions.

#### 4.1.4 Date Handling & Filters

#### 4.1.5 Incentive & Policy View
- Breakdowns by **CAFV_Eligibility** to assess incentive reach.

#### 4.1.6 Business-Oriented Query Design
- Queries framed to answer **who/where/what** (makers, states, models) and **how fast** (range progress), driving **go-to-market** and **policy** choices.
