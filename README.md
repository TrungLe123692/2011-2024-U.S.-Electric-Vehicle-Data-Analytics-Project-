# U.S. Electric Vehicles Data Analytics

## Business Objective 
The objective of this project is to support data-driven strategic decisions in the electric vehicle industry by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). This aims to identify key trends in EV adoption, geographic distribution, manufacturer dominance, and model popularity. Additionally, it evaluates the technological progress in electric range and the influence of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

## About the Data 
The dataset was abtained from the 2011-2024 U.S.Electric Vehicles Dataset available from [2011-2024 U.S. Electric Vehicles Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n3zlk9F1yyNRf92z-tcCnR0tOwQ8_L0Z/view?usp=sharing). It includes attributes such as make, model, model year, vehicle type (BEV or PHEV), electric range, and state of registration. The dataset also includes information about CAFV eligibility, contributing to a comprehensive view of EV distribution, performance, and policy impact. The data includes 17 columns and over 150,000 rows, each representing a registered electric vehicle:
